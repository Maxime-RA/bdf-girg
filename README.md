# BDF-GIRG sampling

Python script for sampling BDF-GIRGs in linear time.
Is a modified version of the Python wrapper [Python wrapper for GIRGs](https://github.com/gavento/girg-sampling)
with minor changes to in the C++ code to sample BDF-GIRGs based on the min-max set and to estimate the threshold constant.

The original GIRG sampling algorithm can be found here [GIRGs sampling library](https://github.com/chistopher/girgs).
And the paper describing the GIRG algorithm [Efficiently Generating Geometric Inhomogeneous and Hyperbolic Random Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06706)
